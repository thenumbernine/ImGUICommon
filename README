ImGui wrapper for ImGui's sdl_opengl_example wrapper for ImGui v1.48

To get this working:

1) change the ImGui Makefile to include examples/sdl_opengl_example/imgui_impl_sdl.cpp in the list of source files
2) build ImGui into libimgui.so/.dylib/.dll
3) Put the libimgui.so/.dylib/.dll in this project's lib/ folder 
4) put all the .h files of ImGui and the examples/sdl_opengl_example/imgui_impl_sdl.h into this project's include/ folder

Viola?
