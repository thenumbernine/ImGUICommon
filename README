ImGui wrapper for ImGui's  sdl_opengl_example wrapper for ImGui

To get this working:

1) build ImGui into libimgui.so/.dylib/whatever and put it in this project's lib folder 
2) build the sdl_opengl_example file (but not its main.c) into libimgui_impl_sdl.dylib and put it in this project's lib folder
3) put all the .h files of ImGui and the sdl_opengl_example into the include/ folder

Viola?
