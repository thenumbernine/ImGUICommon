ImGui wrapper for ImGui, SDL, and OpenGL2 
Uses cimgui / imgui v1.70

To get this working:

1) cmake cimgui.  make sure msvc uses 64-bit via "cmake -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 <dir>"
2) change solution to include examples/imgui_impl_sdl.cpp and examples/imgui_impl_opengl2.cpp in the list of source files
	don't forget to add OpenGL.lib, SDL.lib, and SDLmain.lib to your project ... and add the appropriate GL and SDL include paths
3) build cimgui.so/.dylib/.dll:
5) Put the cimgui.so/.dylib/.dll in this project's folder lib/ folder 
6) put all the .h files of cimgui, imgui, of examples/imgui_impl_sdl.h, and of examples/imgui_impl_opengl2.h into this project's include/ folder
